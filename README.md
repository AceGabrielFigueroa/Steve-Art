# Steve Artistic Application
This repo stores and perserves the code base that Steve has made.

# Objective
Our main objective is to document the code base. We need to do several things in order to achieve this.

1. Sift through the code that Steve has made.
   * Take in-consideration the already made comments that steve has made.
   * Determine the purpose of the functions implemented.
   * Create any additional comments if needed.
     * If you do not understand something, contact the Steve @ steve@schlesinger.com.
     * ~~Learn more about Microsoft Foundation Classes ([MFC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/mfc/mfc-and-atl?view=vs-2017)).~~
     
2. After familiarizing yourself with the code, design a UML diagram
   * A good video to refresh yourself on [UML design](https://youtu.be/UI6lqHOVHic)
   * We will be using a website called [Lucid Chart](https://www.lucidchart.com).
     * To join the shared folder, click [here](https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/6d9d669d-ffb6-4e61-8638-076e51d3de2d).
     
3. Once done creating the UML diagram, proceede to mark any and all MFC dependent classes.
   * We need to re-implement these concepts in-order to make the application platform independent.
   
4. Seperate reusuable code from the MFC.
   * We define reusuable code as any code that isn't MFC, and is part of the main algorithm for image manipulation.
